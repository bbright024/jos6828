# jos6828
the MIT JOS exokernel labs

Sooo this repo has my solutions to the labs from MIT's 6.828 Operating Systems course.  Obviously, not all code in here is mine - the labs gave out skeleton code and I filled in the blanks enough to pass the tests 100% for each assignment.  That is, each assignment except for the final assignment - code a network driver with barely any skeleton code.  I haven't worked on it yet for time reasons - I figure it'd take about 2 weeks, and I doubt anyone would look at it.  It's on my todo list though.
